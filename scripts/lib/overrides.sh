# overrides.sh -- Shared loader for .gembaflow-overrides.
#
# Sourced by template-sync.sh (and downstream pull-upstream.sh) so both flows
# agree on which framework files are intentionally fork-customised and must
# never be overwritten by an upstream sync.
#
# Usage:
#   source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/lib/overrides.sh"
#   load_override_patterns ".gembaflow-overrides"   # populates OVERRIDE_PATTERNS
#   if is_override "scripts/doctor.sh"; then ... ; fi
#
# File format (.gembaflow-overrides):
#   - One path per line, relative to the repo root
#   - Lines starting with `#` are comments
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - Bash glob characters (`*`, `?`, `[...]`) match any portion of the path.
#     Note: bash pattern matching is greedy — `*` will cross `/`, so
#     `scripts/*.sh` also matches `scripts/lib/overrides.sh`. Use a more
#     specific path if you need a narrower match.
#
# Phase 4 rebrand (#335): the default overrides path is now .gembaflow-overrides.
# Callers passing the legacy .agile-flow-overrides path continue to work, and
# load_override_patterns falls back to the legacy file when called with the
# new name on a fork that has not yet migrated.

# Indexed array of patterns loaded from the overrides file.
OVERRIDE_PATTERNS=()

# load_override_patterns <overrides-file>
#
# Populates OVERRIDE_PATTERNS from the given file. If the file does not exist
# (the common case on a fresh fork), OVERRIDE_PATTERNS is left empty and
# is_override always returns 1. This preserves first-run behavior.

  # Phase 4 dual-read: if the requested file does not exist but the legacy
  # .agile-flow-overrides does, transparently use it. Keeps unmigrated forks
  # functional for one release cycle.
